## 2019-2020

### Project (group of 2 or 3 people)
* Option pricing - monte carlo method : Black Scholes diffusion is not enough + choose a convenient option for that
* Parallelism ([concurrent.futures](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html), Joblib, Dask...)
* [Dash](https://dash.plot.ly/) as a service to display web pages: Form to fill the parameters, display the pricing and draw some trajectories
Expected by 6th December
* Readme file is mandatory: how to install, how to use the app

### Exam
to be planned

### Try out collaborative tools
