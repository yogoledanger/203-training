## 2019-2020

### Project (group of 2 or 3 people)
* Option pricing - monte carlo method (Choose a convenient option for that)
* Parallelism (Futures, Joblib...)
* [Dash](https://dash.plot.ly/) as a Graphical User interface (Form to fill the parameters, display the pricing and draw some trajectories)
Expected by 6th December
